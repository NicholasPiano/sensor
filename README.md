# Design choices

I used a few packages I have used before, such as `react-dropzone`, `semantic-ui-react`, `react-final-form`, and `styled-components`.

Some improvements could be made when handling large amounts of data. Currently, there are no loading indicators, for example. There should probably also be pagination for very large datasets.
